# FRONTEND

Built a questions page which displays questions from a backend database and the possible responses for each specific question. The user can then provide different responses by selecting a specific option and the responses after all questions can be then sent to the backend.

# BACKEND

The backend has an API which accesses data from the firestore database and sends it to the frontend which displays the different questions for users to respond to. Then there is another API which collects the different responses sent from the frontend and sends this responses to the backend.
